# territories-game
A package and sample program that manages a Risk-style territorial conquest game. It is still a work in progress.

# Goal
This project is not meant to handle things like turn order, player management, etc. It only is meant to handle things like battle resolution, army management and migration, and map exporting based on the game events. A consuming application is expected to handle the rest of the game logic.
